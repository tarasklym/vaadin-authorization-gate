# Let's use some in-memory caching to reduce the number of runtime lookups against Stormpath.
# A real application might want to use a more robust caching solution (e.g. ehcache or a
# distributed cache).  When using such caches, be aware of your cache TTL settings: too high
# a TTL and the cache won't reflect any potential changes in Stormpath fast enough.  Too low
# and the cache could evict too often, reducing performance.

# The 'urls' section is used for url-based security
